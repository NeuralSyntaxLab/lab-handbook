# Overview
In the lab, we record bird songs. The software part of the recording process includes a digital audio workstation (DAW) named BoomRecorder. BoomRecorder (or any other DAW) integrates with a hardware part (see [Working with Focusrite](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/Ido_Lab-handbook/Sound%20recording/Working%20with%20Focusrite.md) for more detail). BoomRecorder is an intuitive DAW that allows for the recording of multiple tracks. The licensed version of BoomRecorder allows for recording up to 256 tracks. In the lab we use the licensed version of BoomRecorder.
Here, we will introduce the main graphical user interface (GUI) of BoomRecorder, explain how to configure recording settings, and how to route recording tracks to corresponding files and folders.

## Recording screen
The recording GUI is the first screen that opens up, when you open boomrecorder. This screen shows the different channels that the user allocated (see [patch bay]()) and their names. You will also see, the recording, play/pause, stop buttons, and elapsed time and time code. At the bottom there are patch bay button, and more functions which are not usually in use.
