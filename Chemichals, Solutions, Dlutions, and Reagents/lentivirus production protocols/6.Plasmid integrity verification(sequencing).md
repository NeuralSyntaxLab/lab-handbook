=========================================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

Overview:
=========

After we have purified the plasmids, we need to make sure that the plasmid sequence is not mutated. There are a couple of methods to do that. To be strict we can do a couple of them.

I will cover here how to prepare and send samples to the DNA sequencing unit. We need to create a sample that includes double stranded DNA (the plasmid) - 0.7-1.0 µg total.

Here I will cover [how to prepare](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/LS_CoreFacilities/dna-sequencing/sample-preparation) a sample of 1µg of DNA. Sequencing is done by the sequencing unit in the institute.

There is also restriction digestion analysis, which i won't cover here, but can be read [here](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/restriction-digest/).

  

Required Materials:
===================

1.  [Water UltraPure (Dnase/Rnase-Free)](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020043336&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&)
    
2.  Plasmids (purification of A260/A280 = 1.8-2.0; A260/A230 > 1. for further info see [5.  Plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop).](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/lentivirus%20production%20protocols/5.%20plasmid%20concentration%20check.md))
    
3.  0.5ml tubes.
    
4.  0.1-1microliter pipette and tips.
    
5.  1-10µl pipette and tips.
    
6.  2-20 pipette and tips.
    
7.  Stock solution of primers at a concentration of 100µM(can be ordered from Sigma, with the lab's User.)
    

Steps:
======

1.Primer dilution: dilute the 100µM to get a 10 pmol/µl. This is done by a 1:10 dilution.
    

Take 10 µl of 100 µM solution add 90 µl of ultrapure water. This will give you a solution of 10 pmol/µl primer.


2. Plasmid dilution: To a 0.5ml tube add the amount of volume of the plasmid solution which contains 0.7- 1µg of DNA.
    

Calculate the volume of plasmid you need to aspirate to get 0.7-1µg of DNA (1µg =1000ng).
For example, if we have DNA concentration of 1296ng/µl.

We need 1000ng(= 1µg), so to get 1000ng from 1269ng/µl we need to take  1000\[ng\]/ 1296\[ng/µl\] = 0.77µl of plasmid solution.

  


3.  Add 1µl from the 10pmol/µl primer solution to the plasmid containing tube.
    

4.  Add ultrapure water to get a volume of 20µl.
    

If we had 0.77µl(plasmid) + 1µl(primer) add: 20µl-(0.77µl+1µl)=18.23µl of ultrapure water.

5.  Mark the sample tubes with the DNA name and primer (for instance: gcamp6f 3')
    

6.  Once the samples are prepared, you can make an order of sequencing according to [these](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/LS_CoreFacilities/dna-sequencing/how-order) instructions.
    

Notes:
======

* If you have a primer in solution that is 100 micromolar, that is the same as 100 nmol/ml or 100 pmol/µl.
