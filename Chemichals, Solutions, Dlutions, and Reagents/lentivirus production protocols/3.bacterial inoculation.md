  3.bacterial inoculation
====================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  bacteria culture
    
3.  **bacterial inoculation**
    
4.  plasmid purification (maxiprep)
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  plasmid integrity verification  (PCR , restriction digestion analysis ,primer ordering )
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.  virus titer (validation of viral quantity )
    


Overview:
=========

After we have finished step 2, we are supposed to have a plate with single colonies on it (see 2. bacteria culture protocol for further information). from this plate we pick up a single colony and transfer it to a liquid medium such that we can proceed to the next step.

First, we will create what is known as a starter: a single colony will be put in a small amount of media, and after a couple of hours, after the bacteria has grown in the starter, then the starter will be added to a flask with an increased amount of media.

Required Materials:
===================

1.Erlenmeyer  flask for bacerial growth (250-500ml,which ever is comfirtable)

2.1000ml LB medium (can be ordered from internal services )

3.[ampicillin](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020002822&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50) (AMP)(this should be diluted in a ratio of 100 microgram/ml, see notes )

4.shaker incubator(at 37deg Celsius)

5.sterile tips

6.[15ml culture  tubes](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=010017283&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&)

Steps:
======

1.create LB+AMP solution: add 1ml of DDW containing ampicillin (see notes) to 1000ml LB.
  in general the ratio is 1:1000 ml amp in LB

2\. in a 15ml tube, add 3ml LB+AMP

3\. pick up a single colony with a sterile tip and drop it into the 15ml tube with 3ml LB+AMP

4\. put the 15ml tubes, in an incubator shaker for three hours

5.for high copy number plasmids: transfer the liquid from the 15 ml to the 100ml LB+AMP containing Erlenmeyer flask, and close it with aluminum foil.
   for low copy number plasmids: transfer the liquid from the 15 ml to the 100ml LB+AMP containing Erlenmeyer flask, and close it with aluminum foil.
   
  information on copy number can be found on the plasmids Addgene page

6\. put the Erlenmeyer flask in the shaker incubator overnight(12-18 hours).

7.take out the flask from the incubator shaker and proceed to the next step

Notes:
======

* ampicillin comes as a salt,  dilution of ampicillin  can be done in DDW(double distilled water. there's a DDW tap in the lab). the ratio changes, for this protocol 100microgram/ml(equivalent to 1miligram/liter) is used. this means that to make LB+AMP of concentration 1miligram/liter , 1ml AMP is added.
    
* inoculation the process of introducing microbes into a culture media
    
* high/low copy number plasmids refers to the DNA yield per volume of LB culture. A high-copy plasmid should yield between 3-5 ug DNA per 1 ml LB culture, while a low-copy plasmid will yield between 0.2-1 ug DNA per ml of LB culture.
