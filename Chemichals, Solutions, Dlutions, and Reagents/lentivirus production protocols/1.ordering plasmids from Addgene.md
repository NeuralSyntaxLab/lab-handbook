1.ordering plasmids from Addgene
=============================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

Overview:
=========

[Addgene](https://www.addgene.org/) is a company that manufactures plasmids, viruses and more...

Also, their website has lots of information about [molecular biology](https://www.addgene.org/mol-bio-reference/), including [protocols](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/).

To place an order, an Addgene account is required.

Required Materials:
===================

None

Steps:
======

1.  Open an Addgene account(or use the labs account )
    

If you open an account you will have to provide P.I. name and institution

  

2.  Choose plasmid/virus of choice and add  it cart and proceed to checkout
    
3.  Fill in the confirm identity form
    
4.  Shipping should be the address of the institute:
    
Weizmann Institute of Science, 234 Herzl St, PO Box 26 Rehovot 7610001

5.  At the payment  page:
    

             Choose  Purchases order

   Fill in your name at the PO number field

             Billing address should  be identical to the institute's address and attention  should be  payment department, then proceed

6.  After submitting an order, you will have to confirm that you have red the agreements and instructions of oredering and handling plasmids. Then the order will have to be confirmed by a representative of the institute (this is done automatically ).
    

Notes:
======

* Plasmids are sent as a bacterial stab - a vial with agar gel that contains bacteria. upon arrival of the addgene package store it for up to two weeks in a +4deg Celsius (for more detalis see step 2.bacteria culture).

* Be adviced, there are important details which can be found on each plasmid page. For instance lentivirus generatoin, there are 2nd and 3rd generation lentivirus(make sure to check which generation you need, or what packeging plasmid are used, 3rd generation are safer). 
Primers and sequencing information can be found at this page(see step [6.  Plasmid integrity verification  (PCR, restriction digestion analysis, primer ordering)](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/lentivirus%20production%20protocols/6.plasmid%20integrity%20verification(sequencing).md)).
    
* Addgene provides lots of information on the plasmid pages. For our purposes, the most important part is the cloning information which will be used in protocols of step  4 (see step [4.  Plasmid purification (maxiprep)](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/lentivirus%20production%20protocols/4.%20plasmid%20purification.md)).
