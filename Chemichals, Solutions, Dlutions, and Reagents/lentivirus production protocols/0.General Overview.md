# 0.General Overview

There are sevral protocols and steps which are requierd for maikng lentiviruses, here we will list all of the requierd protocols.
  it is advised to read every protocol before making lentivirus, and ask for guidance if needed.  

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  bacteria culture
    
3.  bacterial inoculation
    
4.  plasmid purification (maxiprep)
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  plasmid integrity verificationÂ  (PCR , restriction digestion analysis , primer ordering )
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.  virus titer (validation of viral quantity )
    
Good Luck
