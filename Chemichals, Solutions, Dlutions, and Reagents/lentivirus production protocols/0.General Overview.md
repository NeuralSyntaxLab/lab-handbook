# 0.General Overview

Dear Neural Syntax Lab member, working with viruses it’s a serious thing, before jumping straight into work, please read the instructions bellow and the [Annual safety program](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Annual%20Safety%20Program/asp_cohenlab_uptodate.pdf) carefully, make sure to work with the proper protection clothing and participate in “working with viruses” safety training at the institute (contact safety unit for more details). Lastly, in any case of a safety problem/accident during work with viruses please update Yarden ASAP. 

There are sevral protocols and steps which are requierd for maikng lentiviruses, here we will list all of the requierd protocols.
it is advised to read every protocol before making lentivirus, and ask for guidance if needed.  

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  bacteria culture
    
3.  bacterial inoculation
    
4.  plasmid purification (maxiprep)
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  plasmid integrity verification  (PCR , restriction digestion analysis , primer ordering )
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.  virus titer (validation of viral quantity )
    
Good Luck
