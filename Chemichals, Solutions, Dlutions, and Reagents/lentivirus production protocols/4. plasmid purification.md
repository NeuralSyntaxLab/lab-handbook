# 4. plasmid purification
====================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  bacteria culture
    
3.  bacterial inoculation
    
4.  **plasmid purification (maxiprep)**
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  plasmid integrity verification  (PCR , restriction digestion analysis ,primer ordering )
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.    
    

  

Overview:
=========

Now after we have a huge amount of bacteria in LB, we need to extract the plasmid which contains our desired gene.

this is usually done with a kit special or this purpose, the kits are called miniprep, midiprep and maxiprep. named after the yield of DNA they can achieve(maxiprep will give us the highest concentration out of the three).

different kits pruify DNA with different methods, another  popular kit is QAIEGEN's we have invitrogen's kit.

  

below you can find the full protocol of invitrogen HiPure plasmid purification kits.
