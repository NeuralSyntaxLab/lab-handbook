  3.Bacterial inoculation
====================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

Overview:
=========

After we have finished step 2, we have a plate with single colonies on it (see [2.  Bacteria culture.](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/lentivirus%20production%20protocols/2.bacteria%20culture.md) for further information). From this plate we will pick up a single colony and transfer it to a liquid medium such that we can proceed to the next step.

First, we will create what is known as a starter: a single colony will be put in a small amount of media, after a couple of hours. When the bacteria has grown the starter will be added to a flask with an increased amount of media.

Required Materials:
===================

1.Erlenmeyer  flask for bacerial growth (250-500ml,which ever is comfirtable).

2.1000ml LB medium (can be ordered from internal services).

3.[Ampicillin](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020002822&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50) (AMP). This should be diluted in a ratio of 100 microgram/ml, see notes.

4.Shaker incubator(at 37deg Celsius).

5.Sterile tips.

6.[15ml culture  tubes.](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=010017283&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&)

Steps:
======

1.Create an LB+AMP solution: add 1ml of DDW containing ampicillin (see notes) to 1000ml LB.
  In general the ratio is 1:1000 ml amp in LB.

2\. In a 15ml tube, add 3ml LB+AMP.

3\. Pick up a single colony with a sterile tip and drop it into the 15ml tube with 3ml LB+AMP.

4\. Put the 15ml tubes, in an incubator shaker for three hours. This is the starter.

5.For high copy number plasmids: transfer the starter from the 15ml tube to a *100ml* LB+AMP containing Erlenmeyer flask and close it with aluminum foil.

   For low copy number plasmids: transfer the starter from the 15ml tube to a *250-500ml* LB+AMP containing Erlenmeyer flask and close it with aluminum foil.
   
  Information on copy number can be found on the plasmids Addgene page.

6\. Put the Erlenmeyer flask in a shaker incubator overnight(12-18 hours), at 37deg Celsius with 5% co<sub>2</sub>.

7. Take out the flask from the incubator shaker and proceed to the next step.

Notes:
======

* Ampicillin comes as a salt,  dilution of ampicillin can be done in DDW(double distilled water. there's a DDW tap in the lab). For this protocol we need 100microgram/ml(equivalent to 1miligram/liter). to make LB+AMP of concentration 1miligram/liter , 1mg AMP is added to 1liter of Lb.

    
* Inoculation is the process of introducing microbes into a culture media.
    
* High/low copy number plasmids refers to the DNA yield per volume of LB culture. A high-copy plasmid should yield between 3-5 ug DNA per 1 ml LB culture, while a low-copy plasmid will yield between 0.2-1 ug DNA per ml of LB culture.
