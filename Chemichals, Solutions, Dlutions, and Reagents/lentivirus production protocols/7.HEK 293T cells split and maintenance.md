Overview:
=========

The transfection process requires cells that will serve as a "virus factory" such that the cells will produce the viruses. For cell s to produce viruses we expose the them to several plasmids and perform some manipulations such that the plasmids will enter the cells. In this protocol, i will refer to Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293T).

Cells can be very sensitive, and growing them in a dish outside of a body is not an easy task. To avoid contamination, we need to keep them as clean and sterile as possible.

Cells will die if in a too crowded dish, therefore we need to split the cells from a parent dish to offspring dishes. Every time we split we call it a passage(like a generation) and the number of passages is regarded to as the age of the cells.

The cell density is referred to as confluence.

Before working with the cells a mycoplasma test needs to be done, here i wont go over on how to do it. There are different kits for the mycoplasma test.
We got our cells after they have gone this test.

This protocol is written for splitting dilution of 1:7. Dilution can be calculated specifically to get different confluence. We found that 1:7 dilution worked well during transfection, hence we wont cover other dilutions here.

===================

2.  10cm in diameter Petri dish.

4.  50ml [fetal bovine serum.](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020029213&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&) (FBS),
    
5.  5ml [penicillin-streptomycin](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=Penicillin-Streptomycin&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50) (penstrep).
    
6.  Marker.
    
7.  Pipette controller + serological tips.
    
8.  Biological hood with a suction system.
    
9.  PBS.
    
10. [Trypsin - EDTA 0.25%.](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020048693&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&) solution
    
11. 37 deg Celsius water bath.
    
12. Inverted microscope.
    
13. 70% ethanol for cleaning.
    

  

Steps:
======

Skip the first step if you already have a medium for cell culture

1.  medium preparation:
    
To a bottle of 500ml DMEM add 10% of FBS (50ml) and 1% penstrep (5ml ). Mark the bottle (usually it is marked as DMEME++).
  

2.  Prewarm in a 37deg Celsius  PBS, Trypsin, and DMEM++.
    

3.  Take out the plates from the incubator and watch the plate under the microscope, C   heck their health and confluence. Place them inside the hood(you should work in the hood at all times). Aspirate the media from the plate using a vacuum.

4.  get rid of dead cells and debris: Wash with 2 ml PBS. Pour solution on inclined plate margins. Aspirate PBS. Repeat a couple of times, discard PBS
    

  

5.  Put 1.5 ml of trypsin on a plate. Tilt the plate to spread the enzyme solution all over the plate surface.
    

  

6.  Incubate plate at 37OC for a couple of minutes(usually 0.5 minute-1.5minute is enough). Do not exceed 5 min incubation!
    

  

7.  Remove the plate from the incubator. Tap on a plate side. Do not hit too hard, and do not allow liquid drops to get to the plate cover!
    

                  look at the cells under the microscope to see that they are not attached to the plate surface and are not in clamps.

  

8.  stop Trypsin action: add 5.5ml DMEM++ to the plate
    

calculate the volume by which you want to dilute the cells:

                Cell split dilution varies from 1:11-1:7.

To dilute add y amount of Trypsin to the dish and x-y amount of medium to the dish.

Where y is the amount of trypsin used.

x is the final volume of fluid in the dish according to the desired ratio.

For example:

to dilute a dish to  1:7

y = 1.5ml trypsin

x=7ml

then DMEM++ volume should be  7-1.5=5.5ml of DMEM++. total liquid volume should be  7ml in the plate

  

9.   Mix the suspension thoroughly by pipetting it several times up and down.
    

  

10. Watch the plate under the microscope to make sure cells are adequately separated, and no clusters appear. This step is extremely important for cells seeded for transfection.
    

11.  After the microscope, check and perform up and down pipetting a couple of times, if needed.
    

  

12. Do not let the cells sit unmixed for more than 2-3 minutes! If the cells are sitting for more than 2-3 min. Mix again by washing the plate several times and up and down pipetting.
    

  

13.  Seed the cells in a 10cm plate with a total volume of 10 ml: add 1ml of the cell solution(from the 1:7 diluted parent petri dish)  and 9ml fresh DMEM++
    

  

14. Mark the plates with the date, the cell type, and the dilution. put the cells in the incubator. Once put on the rack inside the incubator move the plate flat on the rack (in a 2d plane) up, down left, and right to make sure the cells are evenly spread.
    

  

Notes:
======

* its always a good practice to look at the plate under the microscope whenever needed or when you are not sure what the status of the cell 
    
* The cells must be split every 2-3 days. Do not split cells two days in a row!!!
    
* Do not pour liquid directly on cells!!! Incline the plate and pour liquids only on the plate margins.
