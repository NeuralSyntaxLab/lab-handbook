===========================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

Overview:
=========

After we have purified our desired plasmid, we want to check the concentration of plasmid in our solution.

This can be done using spectrophotometric methods. Most common is the use of a spectrophotometer called NanoDrop. The NanoDrop can determine the purity of a solution  (how many unrelated macromolecules are in a sample ) and what is the concentration of our desired molecule (can be double-strand DNA, single-strand DNA, RNA, protein...) by measuring the solution light absorption. 

Here i will only write about how to use it. Further information can be found in the attached PDF in the reference section of this page.

Required Materials:
===================

1.NanoDrop.

2.Pen.

3.calibration sample (a clean sample of the solute, without any plasmid) also known as blank.

4.1microliter pipette.

5\. 1.microliter tips.

6.Kimwipes.

7.Test solution (the solution which contains the plasmid).

Steps:
======

1\. Lift the NanoDrop arm and clean with a Kimwipe both sample areas, up and down.

2.Load 1 microliter of calibration solution (blank).

3\. Press the type of molecule its concentration you want to check. For plasmids choose double-strand DNA(dsDNA).

4.After calibration has finished, lift the arm, clean it and load the testing sample.

5.nanodrop will give the concentration, and purity values, if the sample is very contaminated and unusable the machine will notify you. also we can see light absorbance distribution.

Notes:
======

* Nucleic acid concentration is usually measured at 260nm, proteins at 280nm and common solvents at 230nm. This wavelengths are normalized to 10mm pathlength (the distance the light travels,in the sample). The normalized wavelength are refered as A260,A280,A230.
    
* The Ratio A260/A280 indicates the ratio between light absorption by nucleic acids and proteins. Less then 2 is usable.
    
* The ratio A260/A230 indicates the ratio between light absorption by nucleic acids and solvents residus. Between 1.7-3.3 is usable.
