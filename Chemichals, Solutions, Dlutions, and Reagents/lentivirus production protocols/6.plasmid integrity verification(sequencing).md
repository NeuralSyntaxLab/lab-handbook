6.plasmid integrity verification(sequencing)
=========================================================

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  bacteria culture
    
3.  bacterial inoculation
    
4.  plasmid purification (maxiprep)
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  **plasmid integrity verification  (sequencing, restriction digestion analysis, primer ordering )**
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.  virus titer (validation of viral quantity )
    

  

Overview:
=========

After we have purified the plasmids, we need to make sure that the plasmid sequence is not mutated. There are a couple of methods to do that. To be strict we can do a couple of them.

I will cover here how to prepare and send samples for the  DNA sequencing unit.  for plasmids, we need to create a sample that includes  double stranded DNA - 0.7-1.0 µg total.

Here I will cover [how to prepare](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/LS_CoreFacilities/dna-sequencing/sample-preparation) a sample of 1µg of DNA.  sequencing is done by the sequencing unit in the institute

There is also restriction digestion analysis, which i won't cover here, but can be read [here](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/restriction-digest/).

  

Required Materials:
===================

1.  [Water UltraPure (Dnase/Rnase-Free)](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020043336&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&)
    
2.  plasmids (purification of 260/280 = (1.8-2.0); 260/230 > 1, for further info see 6.plasmid concentration check )
    
3.  0.5ml tubes
    
4.  0.1-1microliter pipette and tips
    
5.  1-10µl pipette and   tips
    
6.  2-20 pipette and tips
    
7.  stock solution of primers at a concentration of 100µM(can be ordered from Sigma, with the lab's User.)
    

Steps:
======

1.Primer dilution: dilute the 100µM to get a 10 pmol/µl.  this is done by a 1:10 dilution.
    

take 10 µl of 100 µM solution add 90 µl of ultrapure water. This will give you a solution of 10 pmol/µl primer.


2. Plasmid dilution:to a 0.5ml tube add the amount of volume of the plasmid solution, which contains 0.7- 1µg of DNA .
    

Calculate the volume of plasmid you need to aspirate to get 0.7-1µg of DNA. 1µg =1000ng. for example, if we have DNA concentration of 1296ng/µl (see 6. plasmid concentration check)

we need  1000ng(= 1µg),  so to get 1000ng from 1269ng/µl we need to take,1000\[ng\]/ 1296\[ng/µl\] = 0.77µl of plasmid solution.

  


3.  add 1µl from the 10pmol/µl primer solution to the tube containing the plasmid.
    

4.  add ultrapure water, to get a volume of 20µl
    

if we had 0.77µl(plasmid)+1µl(primer) add:20µl-(0.77µl+1µl)=18.23µl of ultrapure water

5.  mark the sample  tubes with the DNA name and primer(for instance: gcamp6f 3')
    

6.  once the samples are prepared, you can make an order of sequencing according to [these](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/LS_CoreFacilities/dna-sequencing/how-order) instructions 
    

Notes:
======

* If you have a primer in solution that is 100 micromolar, that is the same as 100 nmol/ml or 100 pmol/µl.
