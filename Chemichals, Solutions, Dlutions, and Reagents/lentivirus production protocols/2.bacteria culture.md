 2.bacteria culture
===============================

*this protocol is mostly copied from: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/streak-plate/

  

Several protocols are required to make lentiviruses:

1.  ordering plasmids from Addgene
    
2.  **bacteria culture**
    
3.  bacterial inoculation
    
4.  plasmid purification (maxiprep)
    
5.  plasmid concentration check(NanoDrop)
    
6.  plasmid integrity verification  (PCR , restriction digestion analysis ,primer ordering )
    
7.  cell culture and mycoplasma testing
    
8.  transfection (lentivirus making)
    
9.  virus titer (validation of viral quantity )
    

Overview:
=========

Addgene provides plasmids in a bacterial stab, a bacterial stab is a vial with agar that contains the bacteria with our plasmid.

to produce the plasmid first we need to grow it. Bacteria can be grown on a notorious gel(lb agar plate) in a petri dish(plate), or in a nutritious liquid(referred to as lb) (in suspension ). there are several methods to grow and plate the bacteria, here we will describe one, for further information you can refer to the addgene site , [here](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/streak-plate/) .

we want to streak the plate with some bacteria, so they will grow and form colonies, then we will take an individual colony, which we will grow in a liquid.

our goal in the bacteria culture is to grow bacteria such that it will be easy to isolate one colony of bacteria from the rest .

Required Materials:
===================

1.  sterile [inoculation loops](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=loop&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&)
    
2.  [lb agar plate](https://www1.weizmann.ac.il/rechesh/warehouse-catalog/search-results?searchText=020010278&type=1&fromIndex=1&toIndex=50&) \+ ampicillin 100mg/l (the required  concentration is written in the addgene plasmid page, )
    
3.  bunsen burner
    
4.  bacterial growth incubator (37celsius deg and 5% CO2)
    
5.  70% ethanol.
    
6.  bacterial stab
    

Steps:
======

1.  Obtain an [LB agar plate](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/pouring-lb-agar-plates/) with appropriate antibiotic.
    
2.  Label the bottom of the plate with the plasmid name and the date. It is also a good idea to add the antibiotic resistance and your initials.
    
3.  Sterilize your lab bench by spraying it down with 70% ethanol and wiping it down with a paper towel. Maintain sterility by working near a flame or bunsen burner.
    
4.  Obtain the appropriate bacterial stab
    
5.  Using a sterile loop, pipette tip or toothpick, touch the bacteria growing within the punctured area of the stab culture .
    
6.  Gently spread the bacteria over a section of the plate, as shown in the diagram above, to create streak #1.

7.  Using a fresh, a freshly sterilized loop, drag through streak #1 and spread the bacteria over a second section of the plate, to create streak #2.
    
8.  Using a third sterile pipette tip, toothpick, or sterilized loop, drag through streak #2 and spread the bacteria over the last section of the plate, to create streak #3.
    

Incubate plate with newly plated bacteria overnight (12-18 hours) at 37 °C.

9.  In the morning, single colonies should be visible. A single colony should look like a white dot growing on the solid medium. This dot is composed of millions of genetically identical bacteria that arose from a single bacterium. If the bacterial growth is too dense and you do not see single colonies, re-streak onto a new agar plate to obtain single colonies.
    

Notes:
======

  

* If you use a wire loop you can sterilize it by passing it through a flame, just be sure to allow enough time for the loop to cool before touching it to the bacteria.
    

  

  

* Hold your tooth pick at an angle, the way you would hold a pencil, so that you can make a broad stroke. Only touch the surface of the plate, do NOT dig into the agar.
    

  

* Another very popular technique is to draw in discontinuous lines. Start by streaking a vertical line of bacteria along one edge of the plate. Then streak horizontal lines in another section of the plate, and then diagonal lines in another section of the plate. Make sure that the first line (and only the first) in each new section crosses at least one line of the previous sectio so that it will contain some bacteria.
    

  

  

* Some plasmids or bacteria need to be grown at 30 °C instead of 37 °C. This is often true for large unstable plasmids, which sometimes recombine at 37 °C. Be sure to check this before incubating your plate.
