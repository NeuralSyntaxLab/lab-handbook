## General Tips and Notes

- Label each bottle and weight boat with its content.  
- Tare the scale before weighing each substance to exclude the weight boat's mass.  
- Add water first, then salt, and stir immediately to prevent sedimentation.  
- In case of sediment formation, break it using a spatula.  
- Weight calculation formula:  
 `Weight (g) = Volume (L) × Molecular Weight (g/mol) × Molarity (mol/L)`
- Ensure all molecular weight (MW) values are sourced from the product descriptions specific to your reagents. Adjust calculations accordingly.

## Protocol

### Stage 1: Preparing 500 mL 0.5M Sodium Phosphate Monobasic (NaH₂PO₄)

1. **Calculate the required amount of sodium phosphate monobasic:**  
   - Molecular weight (MW): 119.98 g/mol  
   - Volume (V): 500 mL = 0.5 L  
   - Final concentration: 0.5 mol/L  
   -  - `Weight (g) = 0.5 L × 0.5 mol/L × 119.98 g/mol = 29.995 g`
2. Weigh **29.995 g** of sodium phosphate monobasic.  
3. Add **500 mL** distilled water to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask.  
4. Dissolve the substance using a stirrer until the solution is clear.

### Stage 2: Preparing 500 mL 0.5M Sodium Phosphate Dibasic (Na₂HPO₄)

1. **Calculate the required amount of sodium phosphate dibasic:**  
   - Molecular weight (MW): 141.96 g/mol  
   - Volume (V): 500 mL = 0.5 L  
   - Final concentration: 0.5 mol/L  
   -  - `Weight (g) = 0.5 L × 0.5 mol/L × 141.96 g/mol = 35.495 g`
2. Weigh **35.495 g** of sodium phosphate dibasic.  
3. Add **500 mL** distilled water to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask.  
4. Dissolve the substance using a stirrer until the solution is clear.

### Stage 3: Preparing 1 Liter 0.02M PBS

1. In a **1-liter Erlenmeyer flask**, add **960 mL** distilled water.  
2. Add **7.2 mL** of the 0.5M sodium phosphate monobasic solution (prepared in Stage 1).  
3. Add **32.8 mL** of the 0.5M sodium phosphate dibasic, anhydrous solution (prepared in Stage 2).  
4. Weigh **7.75 g** of NaCl and add it to the 1-liter solution.  
5. Stir the solution manually (e.g., with a spatula) until fully dissolved.  
6. **Check the pH** using pH indicator papers; ensure it falls between **7.4-7.5**.  
7. Seal the flask with **parafilm** and store at **+4°C**.
