Dear Neural Syntax Lab member, working with viruses it’s a serious thing, before jumping straight into work, please read the instructions bellow and the [Annual safety program](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Annual%20Safety%20Program/asp_cohenlab_uptodate.pdf) carefully, make sure to work with the proper protection clothing and participate in “working with viruses” safety training at the institute (contact safety unit for more details). Lastly, in any case of a safety problem/accident during work with viruses please update Yarden ASAP. 

Introduction

This protocol can be used to produce lentivirus from a lentiviral vector transfected into 293T (HEK) cells using a calcium-phosphate transfection protocol. This procedure can be modified for alternative packaging cell lines or transfection reagents. Once produced, lentivirus can be used for a variety of downstream applications.

##
## Workflow Timeline
Day 0: Seed 293T HEK cells

Day 1 (pm): Transfect packaging cells 

Day 2 (am): 12-16 hours post transfection. Remove media, replace with fresh media.

Day 3-4 (am): collect virus.


Reagents

- DMEM high glucose
- Pen/Strep
- FBS (fetal bovine serum)
- Microcentrifuge tubes
- 10 cm tissue culture dishes
- Pipettes
- Pipette tips
- CaCl2
- HBS (Hepes buffer solution)
- Syringes for filtering
- 0.45m filter


Reagents preparation

- Add 50ml FBS and 5ml Pen/Strep to 500 ml DMEM 
- HBS: (*2xHEPES Buffer Saline*):


||Mw|For 200ml|
| :- | :-: | :-: |
|<p>280mM NaCl</p><p></p>|58\.44gr/mole|3\.272gr|
|<p>10mM KCL</p><p></p>|74\.56gr/mole|0\.148gr|

|<p>50mM HEPES</p><p></p>|238\.3gr/mole|2\.38gr|
- Titrate to pH=7.05
- Filter
- Storage: 10ml aliquots at -20°C

**CaCl2:**

||Mw|For 100ml|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2\.5M CaCl2|111gr/mole|27\.72gr|

- Mix with DDW up to 100ml
- Filter
- Storage: 10ml aliquots at -20°C







Procedure

- Thaw Hek cells into a 10cm plate in a 13ml of DMEM (++)(++ means that you have added FBS and Pen/Strp to the media).
- Next day (morning): replace medium to a fresh 10ml DMEM (++)
- Evening: split HEK cells (1:3) (depends on current confluency)

Next day (if cells are 70%-80% confluence):

- Thaw HBS and CaCl2 
- Calculate amounts of microliters you need from each plasmid (3.5 mg of envelope +10 mg from BB plasmid)
- Thaw plasmids (all 4 of them)
- In a 5ml tube: 450microliter DDW, 50microliter CaCl2, plasmids.
- While vertexing, slowly add 500microliters of HBS.
- Let it “rest” 1-2 min (till it look opaque).
- Slowly, pipette the liquid and drip it to the HEK cells plate.
- Mix gently by back-and-forth motion in two directions.
- Incubate 

Next day:

- Replace medium to 7ml fresh DMEM (++)
- Look under the microscope for transfection efficiency, if under than 80% of cells were infected- the process went wrong! prepare new reagents and try once again.

Next day:

- Collect viruses into test tube and add 7 ml DMEM (++) to plate.
- Filter the 7ml media using a 0.45m spinner/ any other filtering method.
- Concentrate by spinning for 90 minutes at 16.5K (48960g on Beckman SW28 rotor). 
- Pour off ALL of supernatant after spinning and let stand on ice for 2hr prior to resuspending with P200 pipette in just the amount of supernatant that pools at the bottom after standing (around 180 mcl).
- Aliquot to 3 microliter PCR tubes and store at –80C.

Next day:

- Collect viruses and repeat the process one more time (2 times total).
- After second time of collecting virus- kill cells using bleach
