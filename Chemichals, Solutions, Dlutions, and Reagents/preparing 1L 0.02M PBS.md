# preparing 1L 0.02M PBS

## Materials:

- Analytical scale
- Stirrer
- Weight boats
- 1 Liter Erlenmeyer flask
- 2x 500ml Erlenmeyer flasks
- 1960 ml distilled H2O
- 7.2 ml 0.5M sodium phosphate monobasic
- 32.8 ml 0.5M sodium phosphate dibasic, anhydrous
- 7.75 g NaCl
- pH indicator papers
- Spatula/spoon
- Parafilm
- Marker

## General tips and notes:

- Label each bottle and weight boat with its content.
- Tare the scale before weighing each substance to exclude the weight boat's mass.
- Add water first, then salt, and immediately stir to prevent sedimentation.
- In case of sediment formation, break it using a spatula.
- Weight calculation is done as follows : Weight  = V[liter] * MW[gram/mol] * M[mol/liter]
- The molecular weights that are mentioned here are according to the product description in each product link.
-  Make sure to make any calculations according to the relevant information to your product.
		

### Stage 1: Preparing 500ml 0.5M Sodium Phosphate Monobasic (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)

1. Calculate the required amount of sodium phosphate monobasic:
	- Molecular weight (MW): 119.98 g/mol
	- V = 500 ml
	- Final concentration = 0.5 mol/liter
	- W<sub>NaH₂PO₄</sub> = 0.5 l * 0.5 mol/l * 119.98 g/mol = 29.995 g
2. Weigh 29.995 g of sodium phosphate monobasic.
3. Add 500 ml distilled water to a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask.
4. Dissolve the solution using a stirrer until clear.

### Stage 2: Preparing 500ml 0.5M Sodium Phosphate Dibasic (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>)

1. Calculate the required amount of sodium phosphate dibasic:
	- Molecular weight (MW): 141.96 g/mol
	- V = 500 ml
	- Final concentration = 0.5 mol/liter
	-W<sub>Na₂HPO₄</sub> = 0.5 l * 0.5 mol/l * 141.96 g/mol = 35.495 g
2. Weigh 35.495 g of sodium phosphate dibasic.
3. Add 500 ml distilled water to a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask.
4. Dissolve the solution using a stirrer until clear.

### Stage 3: Preparing 1 Liter 0.02M PBS

1. To a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask, add 960 ml distilled water.
2. Add 7.2 ml of the sodium phosphate monobasic 0.5M solution prepared in Stage 1.
3. Add 32.8 ml sodium phosphate dibasic, anhydrous 0.5M solution prepared in Stage 2.
4. Weigh 7.75 g NaCl and add it to the 1-liter PBS solution.
5. Stir the solution manually (using a spatula, for instance).
6. Check the solution pH using pH indicator paper; pH should be 7.4-7.5.
7. Seal the Erlenmeyer flasks with parafilm and store at +4 degrees Celsius.
