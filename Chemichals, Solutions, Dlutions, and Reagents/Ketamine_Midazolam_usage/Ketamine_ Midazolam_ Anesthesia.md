# Scientific Protocol: Usage of Ketamine and Midazolam for Anesthetizing Birds

## Overview  
The use of ketamine and midazolam to anesthetize birds is beneficial in birds that do not respond well to isoflurane. This protocol facilitates easier mounting of the bird onto the beak bar during surgery and improves overall handling. Ketamine and midazolam are injected after the bird has been deprived of food and water for at least 15 minutes. During surgery, isoflurane is used to maintain anesthesia, often requiring very low percentages.  
Through testing various dosages, we recommend using **125 mg/kg of ketamine** and **1.5 mg/kg of midazolam**.
We have also tried a Ketamine dosage of 150mg/kg.

## Preparation of Diluted Ketamine and Midazolam Solutions  

1. **Calculating Dosage and Volumes**  
   Use one of the following tools to calculate the injection volume based on the bird's weight:  
   - [Excel Dosage Calculator](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/Ido_Lab-handbook/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/DoseCalculator.xlsx)  
   - [MATLAB Dosage Calculator Script](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/Ido_Lab-handbook/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions%2C%20and%20Reagents/Ketamine_Midazolam_usage/DosageCalculator.m)  

2. **Dilution Preparation**  
   - For **ketamine**: Add the calculated volume of saline and ketamine to a 15 mL tube.  
   - For **midazolam**: Add the calculated volume of saline and midazolam to another 15 mL tube.  

3. **Labeling and Storage**  
   - Clearly label the tubes with the following information:  
     - Your name  
     - Preparation date  
     - Contents (e.g., "Ketamine" or "Midazolam")  
     - Dilution ratio  
   - Store the diluted solutions at room temperature.  
   - Keep the stock solutions of ketamine and midazolam refrigerated at +4°C.

## Bird Injection  

1. **Weighing the Bird**  
   - Place the bird in a plastic shoe cover and secure it to prevent movement.  
   - Record the bird's weight.  

2. **Preparing the Injection**  
   - Draw the required volume of diluted ketamine and midazolam into an insulin syringe, ensuring both solutions are combined in the syringe.  

3. **Injection Procedure**  
   - Apply 70% ethanol to disinfect the lower left abdominal region of the bird.  
   - Inject the solution subcutaneously.  

4. **Observation**  
   - Hold the bird gently in your hands until it becomes unresponsive (approximately 10–15 minutes).  

5. **Surgery Preparation**  
   - Once the bird is anesthetized, mount it onto the beak bar.  
   - Deliver isoflurane as needed to maintain anesthesia throughout the procedure.

This protocol provides a systematic and reproducible method for anesthetizing birds using ketamine and midazolam. Adjust dosages and handling as needed based on species-specific requirements or veterinary guidelines.
