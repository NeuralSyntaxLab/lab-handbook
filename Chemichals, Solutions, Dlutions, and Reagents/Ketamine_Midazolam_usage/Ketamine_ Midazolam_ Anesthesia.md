# Overview 
Usage of Ketamine and Midazolam to anesthetize birds can be very useful in birds that do not respond easily to isoflurane. Also it could result in easier mounting of the bird onto the beakbar during surgry, and overall easier handling of the bird. The Ketamin and Midazolam will be injected after the brid was deprived of food and water for at least 15 minutes. During surgery isoflurane will be used, often very low percentages of isoflurane are requiered to maintain anesthesia.
After trying increasing dosages of Keamine and Midazolam. we have concluded that a dosage of 125mg/kg of ketamine and 1.5mg/kg should be used to induce anesthesis well. 

## requierd materials:
- scale
- plastic shoecover
- diluted ketamine
- diluted midazolam
- insulin syringe
- 70% ethanol
- 15ml tubes
- saline
