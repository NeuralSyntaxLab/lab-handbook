# Implanting a GRIN relay lens above HVC

This protocol details the procedures for implanting a cylindrical (typ. 1mm diameter and about 4mm long) GRIN lens. We detail two main variants of the procedure but it is possible that future projects will require special adaptations. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. how to hold the lens by the stereotaxtic manipulator). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.

## Pre-op procedures
Implanting a GRIN lens is most often a full scale surgery that also includes injecting virus into HVC. The virus injection is details [here](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Surgical%20Procedures/Injecting_into_the_brain.md) and will be referred to from this protocol.  

All pre-op steps appearing in the [general procedures](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Surgical%20Procedures/general_surgical_procedures.md) apply and the surgeon needs to pay extra care in preparing for a long surgery (several hours).

Here we describe additional steps:
### Equipment and materials
**The following equipment is arranged and checked:**
* GRIN lens - checked for damage and disinfected by dipping in ethanol.
* lens holder - custom made.
