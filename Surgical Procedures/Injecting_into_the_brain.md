# Surgical procedures for injecting into the brain

This protocol details the procedures for different types of injections. It is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. injection volumes and planned sites). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.

## Pre-op procedures
An injection surgery is a full scale surgery even though it may take less than 1 hour for an experienced surgeon. Therefore, all pre-op steps appearing in the [general procedures](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Surgical%20Procedures/general_surgical_procedures.md) apply.
Here we describe additional steps:

### Equipment and materials
**The following equipment is arranged and checked:**
* :bangbang: Nano-injector.
* :bangbang: Pipette 10-100uL.
* :bangbang: Pipette tips.
* :bangbang: Glass pipette tips:
	- For a deep injection we pull a pipette with a long neck - 4-5mm of almost equal diameter.
	- For a shallow injection (mostly to HVC) we pull a pipette that becomes narrow quickly and has a short neck ending with small diameter (to protect the tissue). 

**The following materials are prepared:**
* :bangbang: Mineral oil - in a syringe with a long thin blunt needle.
* :bangbang: Parafilm
* :bangbang: Kwik-Sil
* :bangbang: Material to be injected. E.g.:
	- A tracing dye.
	- A virus.
	- A lesioning material.

## Procedures
The main procedures are covered in the [general procedures](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Surgical%20Procedures/general_surgical_procedures.md). Here we describe the steps done after the animal is anesthetized, positioned in the stereotax, and after the zero head is found, the desired angle is set, and the stereotactic zero is set on the Lambda point:

* :bangbang: The location of the injection is marked w.r.t the x,y zero on Lambda.
* :bangbang: A craniotomy above the desired area is made.
	- The area of the craniotomy is the minimal needed for the procedure.
* The exposed dura is irrigated by placing gel-foam soaked in saline. 
	- If needed, saline-soaked gel-foam will be used to irrigate the tissue and prevent dehydration.
* :bangbang: The NanoJect is connected to the stereotax.
* :bangbang: A glass pipette is filled with mineral oil and connected to the NanoJect.
	- The pipette may be trimmed to the desired length.
	- The pipetter is filled entirely so that no air bubbles are seen.
	- The NanoJect plunger is moved a few mm forward and the mineral oil is observed dripping (not on the surgery area).
* :bangbang: A piece of parafilm is used to hold a drop of the injectible material.
	- The injectible material is held in the freezer or in an ice bucket.
	- The 10-100uL pipette is used to take the material and the tip is disposed as biohazardous material. 
* :bangbang: The tip of the glass pipette is dipped in the injectible material, the plunger is pulled to fill the pipette.
	- The pipette is observed via the stereomicroscope while it fills.
	- Errors in sealing or a clog will be indicated if no material is pulled.
* The pipette tip is brought to Lambda and the x,y zero is set.
* The injection location is validated, this time with the loaded pipette.
* :bangbang: The pipette is brought to contact with the surface of the dura and the zero depth is set.
* :bangbang: If using a very thin pipette or injecting into a shallow region (e.g. HVC) a durotomy will be made to allow the needle penetration.
	- The durotomy is minimal, just 200-500um, but if bleeding starts it must be stopped befor injecting.
	- Also, a bleeding may cause clots at the end of the pipette and a clog.
* :bangbang: The pipette is lowered slowly (about 100um/sec and no faster than 500um/sec) to about 0.1mm below the target region and the brain is allowed to settle for a couple of minutes.
* Injections are planned in a minimal number of such insertions to allow covering the target.
* Injections are made in pulses of about 2-5nL with about 2-10 seconds pause between pulses.
	- The miniscus region where the mineral oil and injectible material meet in the glass pipette is observed through the stereomicroscope. This should drop with every pulse.
	- The point where the pipette enters the tissue is also observed through the stereomicroscope to assure that fluid is not coming out.
* A pause of 1 minute is taken when the full planned volume is injected in one site. Then, the pipette is pulled back to a shallower site (if needed).
* Once all planned injections are made in one insertion the pipettes is pulled out:
	- :bangbang: The pipette may clog during the injections.
	- The pipette my be trimmed with scissors to remove a clog.
* :bangbang: Once injections are done the craniotomy may be filled if no more procedures are planned.
	- A soft biocompatible elastomer (Kwik-Sil) is placed on the dura.
	- Dental acrylic can be used on top of the Kwik-Sil (or instead of it if the craniotomy is smaller than 500um)
