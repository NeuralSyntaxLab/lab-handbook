# Implanting stimulation electrodes

This protocol details the procedures for implanting a two-wire stimulaion electrode built with the Omnetics XXX connector. The protocol It is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. injection volumes and planned sites). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.
