# Implanting stimulation electrodes

This protocol details the procedures for implanting two-wire stimulaion electrodes built with the Omnetics A9069-001 connector. It is possible that implanting other electrodes will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. wire material, width, and coating). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.
