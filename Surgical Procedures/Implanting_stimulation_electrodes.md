# Implanting stimulation electrodes

This protocol details procedures for implanting two-wire stimulaion electrodes built with the Omnetics A9069-001 connector. It is possible that implanting other electrodes will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

The protocol describes both acute and chronic implants. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. wire material, width, and coating). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.

## Pre-op procedures
An implant surgery is a full scale surgery even though it may take less than 1 hour for an experienced surgeon. Therefore, all pre-op steps appearing in the [general procedures](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Surgical%20Procedures/general_surgical_procedures.md) apply.
Here we describe additional steps:

### Equipment and materials
**The following equipment is arranged and checked:**

*For implanting:*
* Electrodes to implant.
* Electrode holder:
	- A simple holder of the complementary Omnetics connector (A9577-001) is used to fix the electrode if no stimulation is required during surgery.
	- A holder with wiring of the Omnetics A9577-001 connector is used when stimulation through the electrode is needed during the implantation (e.g. in acute stimulation)
	- A wired A9577-001 connector (without an added mechanical holding strut) is used when implantation is chronic but stimulation is required during the surgery after affixing the electrode the skull (e.g. for some antidromic identification procedures)

*For stimulating during the surgery (if needed):*
* PlexonStim stimulator system as shown here:
