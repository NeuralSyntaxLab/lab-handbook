# General surgical procedures

This protocol outlines the general procedures shared by all surgeries in our lab. That said, it is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. how to pluck feathers or how to keep the birds warm after surgery). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. That said, we mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:. 

## Pre-op procedures
### Animals
* Health charts are inspected prior to bringing animals from the aviary or from an experiment room. Only healthy birds will be fit for surgery.
* The surgeon makes sure that the procedure, including pre-op, starts late ebough so that the animals has time to eat after sunrise, and plans the surgery such that animals will have time to recover, eat, and drink before sunset. If needed, birds will be kept with lights so they get a chance to eat and drink
* Birds are brought to the surgery room in transport cages at least 30 minutes before the anesthesia process starts.
* If more than one bird will undergo surgery then several animals can be brought from the aviary. Each needs to be in its own travel cage and only one is brought into the surgery room at a time. The other birds can be kept in the main lab space or in an experiment room. The idea is to avoid distressing birds.
* Animals are inspected visually and observed to assess their health. Only healthy animals
