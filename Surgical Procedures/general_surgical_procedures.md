# General surgical procedures

This protocol outlines the general procedures shared by all surgeries in our lab. That said, it is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. how to pluck feathers or how to keep the birds warm after surgery). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. That said, we mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:.
