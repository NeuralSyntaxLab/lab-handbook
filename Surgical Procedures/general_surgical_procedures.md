# General surgical procedures

This protocol outlines the general procedures shared by all surgeries in our lab. That said, it is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. how to pluck feathers or how to keep the birds warm after surgery). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:. 

## Pre-op procedures
### Animals
* :bangbang: Health charts are inspected prior to bringing animals from the aviary or from an experiment room. Only healthy birds will be fit for surgery.
* :bangbang: The surgeon makes sure that the procedure, including pre-op, starts late ebough so that the animals has time to eat after sunrise, and plans the surgery such that animals will have time to recover, eat, and drink before sunset. If needed, birds will be kept with lights so they get a chance to eat and drink
* :bangbang: Birds are brought to the surgery room in transport cages at least 30 minutes before the anesthesia process starts.
* :bangbang: If more than one bird will undergo surgery then several animals can be brought from the aviary. Each needs to be in its own travel cage. Birds that are waiting for their surgery can be kept in the main lab space, the surgery room, or in an experiment room. The location and environment should be set to avoid distressing birds.
* :bangbang: Animals are inspected visually and observed to assess their health. Only healthy animals will undergo surgery. 
### Equipment and materials
**The following equipment is arranged and checked:**
* Anesthesia system:
	- We use the GE ISO Tec system pictured here: <img width="100" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216810260-42d7f53f-7f18-448e-95a6-7ddf7a147a43.png">
	- :bangbang: Connections of all the tubes delivering oxygen to and from the vaporizer are checked. 
	- An adequate head cone for induction is connected.
	- :bangbang: The Isoflurane level is checked and filled if less than a third.
	- :bangbang: Check that the Oxygen levels in the outdoors facility are adequate. Alert the service if not.
	- :bangbang: Gas flow is set between 0.4-1l/m.
* Heating system:
	- We use ThermoStar Homeothermic Monitoring System pictured here: <img width="150" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216810956-5b43804d-d9fb-4eab-861b-14b122868a3c.png">
	- :bangbang: The system is turned on.
	- Temperature is set in the ange 37-45 degrees celcius (depends on meterials, drapes, towel on the pad).
* Stereotactic system:
	- We use 1- and 2-arm Kopf's systems - e.g. in this picture:<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216823584-7757f256-66aa-4e3e-90e8-5f1dde4b14cc.png">

* Dental drill system
* Surgery table

* Surgery tools
	- Forcepes
	- Scissors
	- Scalpels
	- Dura picks
