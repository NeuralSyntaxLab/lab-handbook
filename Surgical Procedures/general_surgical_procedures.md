# General surgical procedures

This protocol outlines the general procedures shared by all surgeries in our lab. That said, it is possible that future projects will require special adaptation of these procedures. Thus, we write these protocols in great detail while keeping in mind that these details may change in some projects. 

Additionally, some sections and steps in these surgical procedures have multiple alternatives (e.g. how to pluck feathers or how to keep the birds warm after surgery). We therefore anticipate lab members will shape these procedures for their work. We mark actions that are strictly mandatory with :bangbang:. 

## Pre-op procedures
### Animals
* :bangbang: Health charts are inspected prior to bringing animals from the aviary or from an experiment room. Only healthy birds will be fit for surgery.
* :bangbang: The surgeon makes sure that the procedure, including pre-op, starts late ebough so that the animals has time to eat after sunrise, and plans the surgery such that animals will have time to recover, eat, and drink before sunset. If needed, birds will be kept with lights so they get a chance to eat and drink
* :bangbang: Birds are brought to the surgery room in transport cages at least 30 minutes before the anesthesia process starts.
* :bangbang: If more than one bird will undergo surgery then several animals can be brought from the aviary. Each needs to be in its own travel cage. Birds that are waiting for their surgery can be kept in the main lab space, the surgery room, or in an experiment room. The location and environment should be set to avoid distressing birds.
* :bangbang: Animals are inspected visually and observed to assess their health. Only healthy animals will undergo surgery. 
* :bangbang: Water and food are removed 30 minutes before ansthesia induction. This prevents suffocation.
* :bangbang: Analgesic (Meloxicam 0.5-1 mg/kg) is injected IM either right before commencing surgery or immediately after inducing anesthesia.
* To prevent dehydration, some saline may be injected IC in anticipation of long surgeries.
### Equipment and materials
**The following equipment is arranged and checked:**
* Anesthesia system:
	- We use the GE ISO Tec system pictured here: <img width="100" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216810260-42d7f53f-7f18-448e-95a6-7ddf7a147a43.png">
	- :bangbang: Connections of all the tubes delivering oxygen to and from the vaporizer are checked. 
	- An adequate head cone for induction is connected.
	- :bangbang: The Isoflurane level is checked and filled if less than a third.
	- :bangbang: Check that the Oxygen levels in the outdoors facility are adequate. Alert the service if not.
	- :bangbang: Gas flow is set between 0.4-1l/m.
* Heating system:
	- We use ThermoStar Homeothermic Monitoring System pictured here: <img width="150" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216810956-5b43804d-d9fb-4eab-861b-14b122868a3c.png">
	- :bangbang: The system is turned on.
	- Temperature is set in the ange 37-45 degrees celcius (depends on meterials, drapes, towel on the pad).
* Stereotactic system:
	- We use 1- and 2-arm Kopf's systems - e.g. in this picture:<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216823584-7757f256-66aa-4e3e-90e8-5f1dde4b14cc.png">
	- The smooth motion of the system is checked.
	- The lack of sinking at the end of motion is monitored.
	- The functionality of the electronic panel is checked.
	- :bangbang: The system is turned on.
	- :bangbang: The system's grounding is checked.
* Dental drill system
	- We use a dental turbine as in this picture: <img width="300" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216824737-3ca6faab-65fe-45fe-9711-76e7fb380927.png">
	- :bangbang: The air pressure needs to be on.
	- The air pressure range is set by a regulator to the range of 3-4 bar.
	- The burr is replaced upon need.
	- The turbine is serviced upon need.
	- :bangbang: The pedal is tested before the surgery.
* Surgery table
	- We use a TMC CleanBench air table similar to the one in this picture: <img width="300" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216755685-47d907d8-4411-43b2-b863-e6a2053a407b.png">
	- :bangbang: The air pressure is turned on.
	- The regulator sets the pressure to about 5.4 bar = 80 psi.
	- The table is in a stable position before the surgery starts. 
* Dissection microscope and dissection lights:
	- We use the Leica M80 stereo microscope and the AmScope gooseneck light.
	- The light is tested before the surgery.
	- The microscope's objective lens is verified to meet the surgeon's needs.  
* Surgery tools - each surgeon compiles their set of preferred tools.
	- Forcepes
	- Scissors
	- Scalpel holder + blades.
	- Dura picks
	- Ice bucket

:bangbang: If a possible outcome of the surgery is a perfusion of the animal then preparations should be made following the [euthanasia protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Animal%20Wellfare%20and%20Euthanasia/EuthanasiaProrotocls.md) and the [perfusion protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Histology%20and%20Immunohistochemistry/perfusion_and_brain_extraction.md)

**The following materials are prepared:**

* :bangbang: 70% Ethanol in a testube stand
* :bangbang: Povidine (or similar) in a testube stand
* :bangbang: Lidocaine 2% in saline.
* :bangbang: Q-tips
* :bangbang: Hand warmer
* :bangbang: a glass rod (pipette).
* Sterile Q-tips
* Gel-Foam
* Sterile seline
* Bone cement powder + hardner + stirring cups
* Needles - gauge 30 and 25.
* Insect pins
* Surgical drape
* Ice

### Disinfection
* :bangbang: Quatricide or 10% bleach is sprayed on the surgery table, microscope, stereotactic system, illumintion, and heating systems.
* :bangbang: Surgery tools are sterilized in a hot beads chamber as in this picture: <img width="120" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17324841/216833652-96035623-6b55-4321-b8b6-11cda7422db1.png">
* The sterile drape is laid over the heating pad and extends to one side of the stereotactic system onto the surgery table.
* The sterile surgery tools are laid on the drape. 

## Standard surgery procedures
### Induction
* :bangbang: The anesthesia level is set to 4-5% at a flow of about 0.5 (0.3-1) l/m. The gas flow is set towards the head cone.
* :bangbang: The bird is held by hand in the head cone next to a gas scavenging intake.
* :bangbang: As the anesthetic takes effect the breathing is monitored. 
* The ear holes are exposed using a q-tip dipped in ethanol or water.
* Some head feathers may be plucked in this stage by hand.
* :bangbang: The anesthetic flow is changed to the beak bar of the stereotactic system.
* :bangbang: The beak is held open and the head is placed in the stereotax.
* :bangbang: The anesthesia level is lowered to about 1% (0.5-2) immediately after placing the bird in the stereotax.
* The earbars are pressed to tighten the head's holding. This is checked by pressing the head with a finger.  

### Preparing the surgical arena
* :bangbang: Head and top neck feathers are plucked. 
* :bangbang: The skin is swabbed (scraped gently) with a q-tip dipped in povidine, then with 70% ethanol. This (povidine, ethanol) is repeated 3 times.

### Anesthesia maintenance
**The Anesthesia plane**

Anesthesia is a dynamic process that must be monitored and actively maintained. 

* Generaly, at the gas flow rate of 0.3-1 l/m we aim for an anesthesia *plane* at about 0.5-1% Isoflurane. 
* At this plane the animals are stable in the sense that they do not feel pain (inasmuch as they don't react or wake up during surgery) and are at a low risk of breathing complications. 
* Most birds will have a slow and steady breathing rate at this stage. 
* Very fast breathing is a sign of insufficient anesthesia. 
	- The surgeon can wait a few minutes and let anesthesia settle.
	- It is possible to increase the Iso level by 1-2% for a few minutes.
	- If this does not help it is possible that the bird is irritated. The ears and beak should be checked. Incorrect placement in the earbars can be solved and a local analgesic (lidocaine) can be added to the earbars (rarely needed). The heating pad should be checked.
	- The need to increase the Iso level also occurs in long surgeries as the bird 'gets used' to the anesthesia. *If increasing the Iso, the surgeon must attempt lowering it after a few minutes and be mindful of potential breath deepening and slowing (as below).*
* A very deep breathing is a sign of excessive anesthesia.
	- The surgeon can lower the Iso by about 0.5-1% and wait a few minutes.
	- If the bird also gasps it means that it is under-oxygenated. 
	- In extreme cases te bird should be taken off Iso altogether with close monitoring until breathing improves.

**Note:** The gas flow and Iso levels for achieving an anesthesia plane is a gross estimate since birds really vary from eachother. Some birds are stable at 2% Iso and others at 0.3%. 

### Skin incision
* :bangbang: Lidocaine is injected IC to at the midline from the back to the front most part of the scalp.
* :bangbang: A q-tip is rolled on the skin to spread the analgesic.
* :bangbang: The surgeon waits around 5 minutes to let the analgesic take effect.
* :bangbang: The skin is held with forceps and cut (with a scalpel or with scissors) from the back of the head and all the way to the beak.
	- The back of the incision should not reach to the neck muscles - just to their edge.
* :bangbang: Soft tissue is cleared at the front, revealing a grove in the bone right behind the beak. 
* *Note:* When the skull is exposed it is often very easy to see the 'Lambda' sinus that is used as a zero stereotactic coordinate. As the skull dries it is commonly harder to see Lambda.

### Stereotactic coordinates 
* **Zeroing the head angle:** 
	- A glass pipette is placed on the skull and held, by pressing a finger, in the skull grove right behind the beak.
	- The head is turned until the pipette is parallel to the stereotax and the surgery table.
	- This is referred to as the zero head angle.
	- This is judged by eye. The surgeon observes from the side as the head is rotated.
* **The Lambda point:**
	- The top skull leaflet is removed with a drill above the Lambda sinus at the back of the skull.
	- The bone struts between the two layers of the skull are carefully chipped away allow approach to Lambda.
	- The head is brought to the desired angle w.r.t the zero angle.
	- If hard to see, the illumination neck is brought to the side of the head.
	- The stereotax, mounted with a pointing object is brought to the Lambda point at the bottom skull leaflet.
	- This is the x,y zero of the stereotactic coordinates set.

### Craniotomy
A full craniotomy is expected in all surgeries.
* :bangbang: Means for keeping the brain irrigates are prepared prior to creating a full craniotomy. This can be wet gel-foam pieces in sterile saline (optionally: cold). 
* The bird skull is hollow. It is made of a top and bottom bone leaflets connected with struts.
* The top leaflet is drilled.
* Some struts are then carefully chipped away to allow access to the bottom leaflet.
* The perimeter bottom leaflet is carefully thinned with the drill.
* The thinned skull can be probed and slightly cracked with a syringe's cutting etge.
* The thinned skull is moistened and then picked with a bent syringe.
* Wet gel-foam is placed on the exposed tissue.
* Small bleedings can be stopped with an eye spear, gel-foam, or q-tip.
* Big bleedings (very rare) may require cauterizing.     

### Durotomy
A durotomy is expected in many types of surgeries - but not in all surgeries. 
* :bangbang: Means for keeping the brain irrigates are prepared prior to creating a durotomy.
* :bangbang: Wet gel-foam pieces are prepared to stop bleeding.
* :bangbang: Two dura picks are prepared in the pre-op stage.
* Blood vessels that are potential sources of bleeding should be visible and avoided.
* The two dura picks are used to make a tear in the dura by pulling it in opposite directions.
* The tear should be as small as needed.
* Bleeding is stopped by applying gel-foam (preferrably cold). 

### Creating skull anchors
Skull anchors are used to affix devices onto the skull. This is needed in several, not all, of our procedures.
* **Insect-pin anchors:**
	- Pairs of holes (about 0.5mm diameter) are drilled in the top leaflet of the skull a few mm apart.
	- Insect pins are disinfected by dipping in 70% ethanol, let dry, and threaded through the two holes - going between the two leaflets of the skull without penetrating the bottom leaflet.
	- The pins are glued to the hols with loctite or krazy glue.
	- Bone cement is prepared and is used to cover exposed skull and pins where needed.
* **Acrylic anchors:**
	- Holes (about 0.5mm diameter) are drilled in the top leaflet of the skull.
	- Dental acrylic is applied with a nozzle to the hole such that it covers a diameter of about 1mm around the hole between the skull leaflets.
	- The acrylic is also protruding out of the top leaflet - creating an anchor point.
	- The acrylic is hardened.

### Surgery closure
* In some surgeries the skull is covered with anchor points or bone cement in in others (e.g. in an injection surgery) the skull may remain with no portruding anchors.
* Depending on the type of surgery the surgeon decides whether suturing the skin is needed.
* If so, sutures are made along the midline in several points.
* If needed, the skin is glued, using Loctite, along the midline.
* Antibiotic ointment (Terramycin) is applied to skin edges.
* The bird may be taken off the anesthesia immediately or kept with just oxygen for a couple of minutes andter very close observation. 

## Post-op procedures
### Immediately after surgery
* The bird is watched closely while it lies on the heating pad until motion and, sometimes, vocalising, is changing. If worry arises about breathing, oxygen can be given in the head cone.
* The bird can than be held in the hand with a hand warmer.
* Once the bird regains conciousness, it can be placed back in the cage.
* Soft food, mixed with Oral Meloxicam (1mL of 1.5mg/ml), is given.
* The surgeon makes sure the bird eats and drinks.
* The surgeon fills the first day report of the [post-op card](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Lab%20Forms/Post-Op%20Monitoring%20Cards.pdf).
* The bird is placed in the experiment room.

### In the first 3 days
* Birds are examined at least twice each day.
* Birds are given Meloxicam (Oral in soft food as above, or by injection) daily.
* [Post-op cards](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Lab%20Forms/Post-Op%20Monitoring%20Cards.pdf) are filled daily. These cards are later kept in the project's folder.
* [Regular](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/wiki/Lab-Operations-and-Procedures#health-checks) and project-specific health checks are made each day. 
* [Health alerts](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Lab%20Forms/BirdHealthAlert.pdf) are made if needed.
