## Preparation of Reagents

### 1. **Making 10% Triton X-100 Solution**
Triton X-100 is difficult to dissolve in water due to its soapy nature. Follow these steps to prepare a 10% solution:
1. Decide the total volume of the solution (e.g., 50 mL).
2. Calculate the volume of Triton X-100 to add:
   - **Formula:** `Total Volume × (10/100)`
   - **Example:** For 50 mL: `50 × 0.1 = 5 mL` Triton X-100.
3. Calculate the volume of PBS to add:
   - **Formula:** `Total Volume - Volume of Triton X-100`
   - **Example:** For 50 mL total: `50 - 5 = 45 mL` PBS.
4. Combine Triton X-100 and PBS.
5. Place the solution on an orbital shaker overnight at a very slow speed.

### 2. **Making 0.3% Triton X-100 Solution**
Using the prepared 10% Triton X-100, dilute to a working concentration of 0.3%:
1. Use a dilution ratio of 3:10 (3% of 10% equals 0.3%).
2. Calculate the volumes for 5 mL (5000 µL) of 0.3% Triton X-100:
   - **Volume of 10% Triton X-100:** `5000 × (3/10) = 1500 µL`.
   - **Volume of PBS:** `5000 - 1500 = 3500 µL`.
3. Add the PBS and 10% Triton X-100 to a 15 mL tube. Mix gently to avoid bubble formation.
4. Both 10% and 0.3% Triton solutions can be kept at room temperature.

### 3. **Making DAPI Solution**
DAPI is diluted to a working concentration of 1:2000–1:3000:
1. To prepare 3 mL of DAPI solution at a 1:2000 dilution:
   - **Volume of DAPI:** `3000 × (1/2000) = 1.5 µL`.
   - **Volume of PBS:** `3000 - 1.5 ≈ 3000 µL`.
2. Add the DAPI and PBS to a 5 mL tube and cover it with aluminum foil.
3. Store the DAPI solution at +4°C. Keep the solution covered from light and use it fresh.

## Incubation and Staining Protocol

### Materials
- 24-well plate
- Pasteur pipette
- 200 µL pipette and tips
- Serological pipette

### 1. **Preparation**
1. Fill a 24-well plate with 500 µL PBS per well.

### 2. **Transfer Slices**
1. Transfer the tissue slices to the wells, ensuring one slice per well.
2. Use a Pasteur pipette to gently remove PBS and discard it.

### 3. **Triton X-100 Incubation**
1. Using a pipette, gently add 200 µL of 0.3% Triton X-100 solution to each well. This should be done by gently releasing the liquid onto the wall of the well and not directly onto the slice. Ensure the slices are not folded.
2. Incubate for 15 minutes.
3. Discard the Triton X-100 solution as done previously.

### 4. **DAPI Staining**
1. Add 200 µL of the DAPI solution to each well.
2. Incubate for 2–3 minutes.
3. Discard the DAPI solution into a designated container.

### 5. **PBS Washes**
1. Wash slices with PBS three times, with 3-minute intervals between washes:
   - Add PBS, wait 3 minutes, discard PBS.
2. Ensure slices remain submerged in PBS at the end of the process.

## Notes
- Gently apply any liquid onto slices by releasing liquid onto each well's wall and not directly onto the slices.
- Always handle DAPI in low-light conditions to avoid photobleaching.
- Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent bubble formation in Triton X-100 solutions.
- Discard all waste solutions in designated containers following safety guidelines.
