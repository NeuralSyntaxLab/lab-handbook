# Nissl staining of paraformaldehyde (4%) fixed brain tissues:

This protocol build on [the well established protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Histology%20and%20Immunohistochemistry/_creysl_violet_stain_neurosciencecourses.pdf) and is optimized to slice thickness between 70 and 100 micrometers; thinner slices may need to be treated differently.

## Preparation
After sectioning with the Vibratome, rinse the slices in distilled water and mount on charged glass slides. If the tissue is sectioned using the cryostat, slices should be washed 3x in 1xPBS for 5 minutes for each wash.

*Note:* if you are using regular glass slides, slices may fall off the slides during the staining process!

Let the slices on the glass slide dry for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.

## Staining Process 
Once you make sure the slices are dry enough, start the staining process:
* Put in 95% ethanol for 5 minutes
* Put in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes
* Put in distilled water for 5 minutes 
* Put in 1:2 diluted Cresyl Violet for 6 minutes (abcam, Cresyl Violet Stain Solution (1%), ab246817) 
* Put in distilled water for 5 minutes 
* Put in 70% ethanol for 2 minutes 
* Put in 95% ethanol for 1 minutes 
* Dip 2 times in 100% ethanol, and check quickly under the microscope, and if needed adjust the staining level by going backward and stain or wash more to the desired level. 
* Put in histoclear or Xylene for 5 minutes 
* Mount the slide with DPX
* Put coverslip and let the slide dry at room temperature.

*Note:* This protocol, unlike protocols using different mounting media, does not require sealing the sides of the slide with nail polish.
