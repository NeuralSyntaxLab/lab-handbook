* Both Zebra finches and canaries will be killed by injection of Sodium pentobarbital (euthasol).
* The euthasol solution will be prepared in advance following our [protocol](tbd.link) and kept in a locked cabinet or safe.
* Birds will be killed in an environment that causes minimal distress, preferrably in a quiet room without bright lights and by performing actions without erratic movements.
* Birds will be held and injected, IC (intracoelomic), with 250mg/kg euthasol (this is 0.1-0.2ml of the strandard solution in Zebra finches and 0.2-0.3ml in canaries)
* For precise IC route, birds are held on their back and the botom part of the abdomen, at a third of the distance to the ribs, is located. Injection is slightly to the side of the midline.
* Birds are held until they stop moving and, quite often, close their eyes.
