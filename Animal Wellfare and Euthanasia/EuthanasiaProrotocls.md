# Euthanasia

### Big picture
---
Birds will be killed following strict end-point guidelines. General guidelines are mentioned in [our Wiki](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/wiki/Lab-Operations-and-Procedures#euthanasia) and others may be project-specific. 

* Birds in a running experiment will be killed after obtaining approval by the PI. 
* Birds in the lab that are not in an experiment will be killed after obtaining approval of the PI or the accompanying vet. 
* Despite this, birds under severe distress or suffering that meet end-point requirements will be killed with no need for approval. 

We separate euthaniasia procedures into three distinct cases:

1. **General end-point:** Birds that are killed due to health issues or planned end points that are not for perfusion.
2. **Prior to perfusion and necropsy:** We kill birds prior to performing perfusion and necropsy. This procedure is slightly different than the general case.
3. **During surgery:** Birds may be killed during a surgery to prevent unnecessary suffering.

### Detailed protocols
---
1. **General end-point:**
This protocol is used to humanely kill a bird when its brain, or any other part, is not needed.

*Preparation:*
* Both Zebra finches and canaries will be killed by injection of Sodium pentobarbital (euthasol).
* The euthasol solution will be prepared in advance following our [protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions/GeneralLabDilutionsSolutions.md) and kept in a locked cabinet or safe.
* Before killing a bird we prepare an environment that causes minimal distress, preferrably in a quiet room without bright lights.
* A 1mL syringe with a 30 gauge needle is prepared with 0.2mL solution for a Zebra finch or 0.3mL for a canary.
* Multiple syringes are prepared if needing to kill multiple birds. Killing multiple birds by loading one syringe with more solution is to be avoided. 
* The syringe is kept without a strongly-attched cap. Unlocking or releasing a cap may cause problems. 
* Decapitation scissors are available in the room.
* A spray bottle with 70% ethanol is available in the room.
* Gloves are available in the room.

*Procedure:*
* Gloves are worn before beginning the procedure.
* The bird is brought to the prepared environment in a cage or, if brought from a setup, held by hand.
* Actions are performed without erratic movements to avoid stress (of both the human and the bird).
* For precise IC route, the bird are held on their back and the botom part of the abdomen, at a third of the distance to the ribs, is located. Injection is slightly to the side of the midline.
* The bird is injected, IC (intracoelomic), with 250mg/kg euthasol (this is 0.1-0.2ml of the strandard solution in Zebra finches and 0.2-0.3ml in canaries)
* The bird is held until breathing stops and the heartbeat is no longer fealt.
* When breathing stops, the lack of sensation is checked by a toe-pinch. Birds will pull their legs if sensing the pinch.
* When the toe pinch does not cause reaction the bird will be decapitated.
* The carcass (body and head) will be rolled into the glove of one hand and then into the other glove.
* The last glove will be tied.
* The carcass will be disposed in the freezer next to the hood.

2. **Prior to perfusion and necropsy:**
This protocol is used to humanely kill a bird right before a perfusion (e.g. when its brain is need). It's main difference from the above protocol is that we do not decapitate the bird but, rather, move on with the perfusion process once sensation is gone and breathing stops but before the heart stops.

*Preparation:*
* First, all the preparation steps for perfusion are followed as detailed [here](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Histology%20and%20Immunohistochemistry/perfusion_and_brain_extraction.md). 
* Both Zebra finches and canaries will be killed by injection of Sodium pentobarbital (euthasol).
* The euthasol solution will be prepared in advance following our [protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Chemichals%2C%20Solutions%2C%20Dlutions/GeneralLabDilutionsSolutions.md) and kept in a locked cabinet or safe.
* Killing will be done next to the hood. The environment should be quiet and calm as possible.
* The bay next to the hood must be cleared of obstructions.
* A 1mL syringe with a 30 gauge needle is prepared with 0.2mL solution for a Zebra finch or 0.3mL for a canary.
* The syringe is kept without a strongly-attched cap. Unlocking or releasing a cap may cause problems. 
* A spray bottle with 70% ethanol is next to the hood.
* Gloves are available next to the hood.
* A biohazard waste recepticle with ample room is placed next to the hood.

*Procedure:*
* Gloves are worn before beginning the procedure.
* The bird is brought to the prepared environment in a cage or, if brought from a setup, held by hand.
* Actions are performed without erratic movements to avoid stress (of both the human and the bird).
* For precise IC route, the bird are held on their back and the botom part of the abdomen, at a third of the distance to the ribs, is located. Injection is slightly to the side of the midline.
* The bird is injected, IC (intracoelomic), with 250mg/kg euthasol (this is 0.1-0.2ml of the strandard solution in Zebra finches and 0.2-0.3ml in canaries)
* The bird is held in the hand and closely monitored.
* Once breathing is no longer observed a toe-pinch test, as above, is used to assure lack of sensation.
* At this point the feathers from the entire abdomen and the neck are plucked.
* The bird is attached to the perfusion tray and the [perfusion protocol](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/lab-handbook/blob/main/Histology%20and%20Immunohistochemistry/perfusion_and_brain_extraction.md) is followed.
* Carcass remainders are disposed of in the freezer next to the hood.
