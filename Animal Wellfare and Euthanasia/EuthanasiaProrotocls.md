# Euthanasia

Birds will be killed following strict end-point guidelines. General guidelines are mentioned above and others may be project-specific. Needless to say, get aquainted with the papproved protocols for your experiment. Birds in an experiment will be killed after obtaining approval by the PI. Birds in the lab that are not in an experiment will be killed after obtaining approval of the PI or the accompanying vet. Despite this, birds under severe distress or suffering that meet end-point requirements will be killed with no need for approval. We separate euthaniasia procedures into three distinct cases:

1. **General end-point:** Birds that are killed due to health issues (e.g. above) or other planned end points.
2. **Prior to perfusion and necropsy:** We kill birds prior to performing perfusion and necropsy. This procedure is slightly different than the general case.
3. **During surgery:** Birds may be killed during a surgery to prevent unnecessary suffering.

* Both Zebra finches and canaries will be killed by injection of Sodium pentobarbital (euthasol).
* The euthasol solution will be prepared in advance following our [protocol](tbd.link) and kept in a locked cabinet or safe.
* Birds will be killed in an environment that causes minimal distress, preferrably in a quiet room without bright lights and by performing actions without erratic movements.
* Birds will be held and injected, IC (intracoelomic), with 250mg/kg euthasol (this is 0.1-0.2ml of the strandard solution in Zebra finches and 0.2-0.3ml in canaries)
* For precise IC route, birds are held on their back and the botom part of the abdomen, at a third of the distance to the ribs, is located. Injection is slightly to the side of the midline.
* Birds are held until they stop moving and, quite often, close their eyes.
