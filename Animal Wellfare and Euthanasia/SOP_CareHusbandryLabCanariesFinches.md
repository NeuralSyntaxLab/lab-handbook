# SOP: Care and husbandry of laboratory canaries and finches.

## Purpose
This document wil describe how husbandry and care of canary and finch songbirds will be accomplished in the Cohen lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all lab members and Veterinary Resources (VR) personnel responsible for husbandry and care of songbirds housed in the Cohen lab.

## Responsibility
* The Principal Investigator (PI) and laboratory personnel will be responsible for the general care and maintenance, as well as daily health checks, of all birds housed in the lab.
* The Principal Investigator (PI) and laboratory personnel will be responsible for communicating with VR personnel to facilitate the VR personnel's aid in bird care.
* Following coordination with the PI and lab personnel, the VR personnel will be responsible to aid in general care and maintenance, as well as daily health checks, of birds housed in the lab.

## Background
In order to have consistent care for birds housed in the Cohen lab, this document outlines the conditions, procedures, and frequency with which procedures will be performed for bird care.

## Procedures and requirements
### Temperature
* Thermometers should be on the wall in every experiment room. Room temperature should be
between 24℃ and 29℃. 
* If the temperature is out of range:
	- An alert will be indicated in the VR control room (TBD).
	- During working hours, the control room staff will notify lab personnel, the vet, the PI, and Facilities. Lab personnel and Facilities will liaise to correct the problem.
	- During evenings, weekends, or holidays, the control room staff will notify the VR personnel in the aviary / veterinarian on call, who will contact Facilities to rectify the issue. The PI will be notified of the issue by email.

### Light
* Full spectrum light is important for finches and to a lesser extent to canaries. They see part of the UV spectrum we do not.
* Finches are to be kept on a 14/10 light/dark cycle (e.g. 7am-9pm).
* Canaries are to be kept on a light/dark cycle that reflects the seasonal changes:
	- Canaries in the "Synchronous Colony" are kept in the aviary (using an astronomical clock) on a light/dark cycle that matches the northern hemisphere (optimally, Israel's latitude and longitude). Lab personnel make sure that canaries from the Synchronous Colony will be kept on this light/dark cycle when housed in the lab (using the lab's in-house developed systems).
	- Canaries in the "Asynchronous Colony" are kept in the aviary (using an astronomical clock) on a light/dark cycle that matches the southern hemisphere (optimally, the negative of Israel's latitude and the same as Israel's longitude). Lab personnel make sure that canaries from the Asynchronous Colony will be kept on this light/dark cycle when housed in the lab (using the lab's in-house developed systems).
	- Birds should not be disturbed during night hours except in an emergency.

### Humidity
* Hygrometers should be on the wall in every room. Humidity should be between 40% & 60%.
* If the humidity is out of range, alert will be indicated in the VR control room (TBD).
* The control room staff will notify lab personnel, the vet, the PI, and Facilities. Lab personnel and Facilities will liaise to correct the problem.
* Humidifiers may be addded in exterme malfunction of the facility's humidity control.

### Husbandry
* Birds in the lab are most often housed individually in soundproof boxes. Cages size and implements allow birds to perch comfortably and display normal healthy behavior expected from songbirds in stress-free conditions.
* Floor paper in the cages will be changed a minimum of twice weekly. Cages are washed and sterilized every 22 weeks, or as soon as it becomes visibly dirty, whichever comes first (put on dirty rack in aviary).
* *Water*: clean water must be made available to birds at all times. Suspended water bottles rather than open cups should be used. Each bottle should be placed near a perch or the cage floor so that birds can access the water by perching. Bottles should be refilled with fresh water every day. Bottles should be cleaned once weekly.
* *Seed*: Finches and canaries eat mostly seed; high quality seed which contains a combination of grains and seeds is desirable. Each species has their own seed mix and care should be taken not to confuse between Finch and Canary seed. The seed should be dispensed in cups, hanging or on the cage floor, 2-4 per cage. The seed level should be checked and replenished daily. Seed hulls should be removed from the seed cups because they hide the seed below. To maintain cleanliness, the cups should never be placed below perches.
* *Grit*: Each cage must contain a cup of grit (sand, shell, charcoal and vitamins/minerals) which aids digestion and provides trace minerals. Grit should be clean and amounts checked daily.
* *Cuttlebone*: cuttlebone must be mounted to the side of each cage or placed on the floor with the calcium deposit side facing into the cage and placed where birds can perch to eat the calcium. Cuttlebone should not be placed under perches, seed cups or grit cups so that they remain clear of droppings.

### Enrichment
* *Perches*: Each cage will be equipped with at least one perch. Wood and sandy perches allow birds to wear down their claws and exercise their feet. Variable width perches are better for exercising the feet and prevent foot infections. Since these perches are not completely sanitizable, they will be periodically replaced.
* *Baths*: When allowed by the experimental conditions, birds will be provided baths twice weekly. Bathing reduces feather picking and prevents invasion of mites. Baths should be placed in cages for 2-3 hours and then removed.
* *Greens*: Twice per week, each cage will receive a freshly washed piece of lettuce leaf or several spinach leaves (shaken dry). Leaves can be placed between the cage wires or on the cage floor if it is clean. The remains of the greens (if any) should be removed after 24 hours.
* *Eggs*: All birds get a small amount of ground hardboiled eggs (including shells) once per week. The eggs will be placed on the cage floor. Eggs may be replaced by an adequate soft-food.

### Health care & monitoring
* Inspections are conducted by members of the laboratory on weekdays.
* On weekends, or holidays, inspections may be conducted by VR staff after coordination with lab members.
* Inspections are conducted once per day for all birds for which there is no health alert. 
* Inspections are conducted twice per day for birds with health alert (sick or post-surgery).
* Health issues are reported to the PI/veterinarian who, in cooperation with the laboratory staff, determine appropriate care.
